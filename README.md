# [Budget Tracker] (https://aqueous-tundra-37394.herokuapp.com/)


## Description
Budget Tracker is a full-stack web app that enables user to keep track of their income and budgets in form of graph.

This app was build around Service worker, Cache API and IndexedDB as its core. My task is to take the pre-built HTML, CSS and JS
and create the front-end offline functionality that allows it to save files and data to the user's local files when internet connection
was not found.
